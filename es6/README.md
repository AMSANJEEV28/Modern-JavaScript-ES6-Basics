## Course Description
In this project-based course, I have gained a solid understanding of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), the latest version of JavaScript. Throughout the course, I have learned the major features of ES6 and how to apply them in practical situations. Additionally, I have explored the differences between JavaScript and ECMAScript.

## Course Objectives
By completing this course, I have achieved the following learning objectives:

1. ðŸ§  Understand the major features of ES6.
2. ðŸ’» Apply ES6 concepts in real-world scenarios.
3. ðŸ”§ Fix any issues caused by the 'this' keyword.
4. ðŸ”„ Differentiate between JavaScript and ECMAScript.

## Course Structure
This course was divided into three parts, allowing me to gradually build my knowledge and skills:

1. Course Overview: An introductory reading material to set the foundation.
2. Modern JavaScript: ES6 Basics: A hands-on project that I have worked on using Rhyme.
3. Graded Quiz: A final assignment to assess my understanding of the course materials.

## Project Structure
The hands-on project, Modern JavaScript: ES6 Basics, comprised the following tasks that I have completed:

1. Task 1: Getting started
2. Task 2: Variables (let) and Scoping
3. Task 3: Variables (const) and Immutability
4. Task 4: Extracting data with Destructuring
5. Task 5: Strings and Interpolation
6. Task 6: Arrow functions basics
7. Task 7: Arrow functions and "this"

This repository contains the code I have written and the examples I have studied throughout the course. Feel free to explore the code and leverage the projects to further enhance your understanding of ES6 concepts. Happy coding! ðŸš€
